# cats-listing-demo-dotnet-core

A cats listing demo project with .Net Core MVC following SOLID principles.

Notes:

This application was developed in May 2018 using VS2017 by Gabriel Mendez (Github user mendezgabriel) as a web application using MVC (.net core) to demonstrate the use of best practices patterns known as the SOLID principles to create a separation of concerns between different sections and dependencies of a system and to make it easier to test.

It uses dependency injection to resolve all dependencies.

In a real world scenario improvements should be made to this implementation like data validation, caching, error handling and OO client side code by using a combination of typescript and MVVM javascript frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue or Knockout.

Requirements:

VS2017 for debugging and .Net Core 2.0 SDK/Runtime
